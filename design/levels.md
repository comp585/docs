# Levels

- Rounds are used to switch between players, rotating between them to be the teller on the hot seat or be an investigator.

- Each round provides the round number, as well as an overview of the number of points that each player has.

- If the bot is interacted with for the first time, or it is restarted, there is a tutorial dialogue that explains the game logic to the user.

- The players success is gauged on their number of points at the beginning of each new round.
